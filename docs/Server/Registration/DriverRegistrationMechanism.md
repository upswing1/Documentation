title: Registration Process for Drivers in a Client-Server Application
---

## Overview

To ensure a secure and efficient registration process for drivers in our client-server application, we are implementing a system that uses both a company-wide registration code and a driver-specific registration code. This method ensures that only authorized drivers can register while maintaining the simplicity of managing company-wide access.

## Process Description

### Generating Registration Codes

- **Company-Wide Registration Code**: A unique registration code is generated for each company. This code is used to identify the company and ensure that only drivers belonging to this company can register.
- **Driver-Specific Registration Code**: For each new driver, a unique registration code is generated. This code ensures that each driver can be individually identified and verified during the registration process.

### Storing Registration Codes

The company-wide registration code and driver-specific registration codes are securely stored in the database. These codes are associated with their respective company and driver records.

### Communicating Registration Codes

The company-wide registration code and the driver-specific registration code are communicated to the driver through secure channels such as encrypted email or secure messaging apps. This ensures that the codes are not exposed to unauthorized parties.

### Registration API

An API endpoint is provided to validate the registration codes and register the driver. The endpoint checks the validity and expiration of the codes, ensuring they match and belong to the same company. Upon successful validation, the driver is allowed to create a username and password, completing the registration process.

## Security Considerations

- **Secure Communication**: All registration codes are communicated through secure channels to prevent interception by unauthorized parties.
- **Code Expiration**: Registration codes have an expiration date to limit the window of opportunity for misuse.
- **Hashing Passwords**: Passwords are hashed before storing them in the database to ensure they are not exposed even if the database is compromised.
- **Code Validation**: The server validates both the company-wide and driver-specific registration codes to ensure they are valid and match the intended company and driver.

## Implementation Details

### Server-Side Code

**Generate and Store Registration Codes**:
```csharp
public class RegistrationCodeService
{
    private readonly MyDbContext _context;
    private readonly Random _random = new Random();

    public RegistrationCodeService(MyDbContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
    }

    public string GenerateCompanyRegistrationCode(int companyId)
    {
        const string chars = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789";
        string code = new string(Enumerable.Repeat(chars, 8)
          .Select(s => s[_random.Next(s.Length)]).ToArray());

        var companyRegistrationCode = new CompanyRegistrationCode
        {
            Code = code,
            CompanyId = companyId,
            ExpirationDate = DateTime.UtcNow.AddDays(30) // Code expires in 30 days
        };

        _context.CompanyRegistrationCodes.Add(companyRegistrationCode);
        _context.SaveChanges();

        return code;
    }

    public string GenerateDriverRegistrationCode(int driverId, int companyId)
    {
        const string chars = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789";
        string code = new string(Enumerable.Repeat(chars, 8)
          .Select(s => s[_random.Next(s.Length)]).ToArray());

        var driverRegistrationCode = new DriverRegistrationCode
        {
            Code = code,
            DriverId = driverId,
            CompanyId = companyId,
            ExpirationDate = DateTime.UtcNow.AddDays(30) // Code expires in 30 days
        };

        _context.DriverRegistrationCodes.Add(driverRegistrationCode);
        _context.SaveChanges();

        return code;
    }

    public void SendRegistrationCodes(string email, string companyCode, string driverCode)
    {
        // Implement email sending logic using a secure email service
        // Ensure to use SSL/TTLS for sending emails
    }
}

## Conclusion

By implementing a dual-code registration system, we enhance the security and manageability of driver registrations in our client-server application. The company-wide code ensures that only drivers from the specified company can register, while the driver-specific code provides an additional layer of verification, ensuring that each driver is uniquely identified and authorized to create an account. This approach balances security, simplicity, and scalability, providing a robust solution for managing driver registrations.
