# Initialization Mechanism

## Introduction

This document outlines the initialization mechanism implemented in the CRM application, detailing the overall flow expected during startup.

## Initialization Mechanism

### Password Policy and Security Questions

Upon starting the application, a request is automatically sent to the server to retrieve the latest password policy and security questions. This ensures that the application is up-to-date with the latest security measures.

### Automatic Password Reset for First-Time Users

First-time users are required to change their password immediately upon logging in. The application will automatically open the password change page for these users. A user is considered a first-time user if a specific flag is set within the application. The new password must comply with the current password policy requirements.

### Automatic User Registration

If a user is not registered, the application will open a registration form on a new page, allowing the user to complete the registration process.

### Login

Once a user is registered, the Login page will become accessible, allowing the user to log in to the application.

### Network Page

If at any point there is a failure in communicating with the server, the application will open a network status page to inform the user of the connectivity issue.

## Conclusion

The initialization mechanism in the CRM application is designed to ensure a secure and seamless startup experience for users. By enforcing password policies, facilitating automatic registration, and handling network issues gracefully, the application aims to provide a robust and user-friendly environment. This document provides an overview of the steps involved in the initialization process, ensuring that all users are guided through the necessary security and setup procedures upon starting the application.
